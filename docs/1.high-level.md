# High-level architecture

The whole project is basically an integration for existing applications to help visualize behavior of generic data structures. Currently design supports node-based structures but existing facilities can be expanded to implement iterator-, array- and vector-based structures.

This integration is built upon 3 main 'building' blocks:
* backbone API,
* visual representation using SFML library,
* user code.

### Terminology used

**Entity** is an object which represents unit of a scene - that is it can be drawn (example: node, edge).

**Scene** is an environment in which entities exist. Scenes can be switched from one into another.

## Backbone API

This is the main part that ties together user interactions with internal visual and logical representations of entities.

API is used to command thread that is responsible for scene updates.

## Visual representation

This is the part that user can observe. It contains drawn entities, visual cues (connection types, weights, highlights) and elements of an UI.

## User code

User code is used to indirectly apply commands to the backbone through API. Without user code/applications there's no direct usage of this integration.
