# Requirements

## Functional

1. User can see changes algorithm relative to the code written
2. User can interact with nodes directly - drag, invoke contextual menus
3. User can interact with nodes and its environment programmatically - change colors (BG/FG/Nodes/Outlines/Highlights)
4. User can scroll the image in both directions

## Non-functional

1. Each structure has its own spacing and offsetting properties to correctly represent given data structure
2. Node contents (data) can be displayed with custom representation
3. *Subjective*: application should be able to display relatively big amount of data in terms of educational visualization - that is scope and scale of it can be perceived (up to ~10k nodes) without severe framerate drop.
4. Whole system can be extended: from entities and connection to scenes and UI.
